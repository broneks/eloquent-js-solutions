/*!
 *  Artificial stupidity
 *
 *  Having the inhabitants of our world go extinct after a few minutes 
 *  is kind of depressing. To deal with this, we could try to create a smarter plant eater.
 *
 *  There are several obvious problems with our herbivores. First, they are terribly 
 *  greedy, stuffing themselves with every plant they see until they have wiped out the 
 *  local plant life. Second, their randomized movement (recall that the view.find method 
 *  returns a random direction when multiple directions match) causes them to stumble around 
 *  ineffectively and starve if there donâ€™t happen to be any plants nearby. And finally, they 
 *  breed very fast, which makes the cycles between abundance and famine quite intense.
 *
 *  Write a new critter type that tries to address one or more of these points and substitute 
 *  it for the old PlantEater type in the valley world. See how it fares. Tweak it some more if necessary.
